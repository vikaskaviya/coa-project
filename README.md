DEVELOPED AN I.S.A WHICH PERFORMS BASIC ARITHMETIC AND LOGICAL FUNCTIONS.
- I.S.A which understand user inputs(assembly language codes) and gives desired outputs.
- Two pass assembler Implementation with hypothetical Instruction set architecture using C . Pass 1 was to create separate the symbol table, mnemonic opcode table, and operand fields,determine the storage- required for every assembly language statement and update the location counter.
- Pass 2 was to create machine code using the translation of opcode and symbolic operands,generate value defined by different data types.
